# Wildlife-Migration-SAS
In this project, I used SAS to study whether different pharmaceutical implants affected Atlantic salmon migration. I analyzed fish size, implant type, and migration time, and used box plots and confidence intervals to compare groups. I also ran a t-test and a chi-square test of independence to see whether implant type was associated with migration differences.
